# learningObjectives
 My aim is to successfully transition careers to become a Junior Software Engineer. I have been encouraged to document journey, so here it goes....

 First, I want to establish my 'why' to be consistent with my learning:

 * My first degree @ University was in Computer Science. I was excited about the prospect of studying computer Science. However, I quit after my first year. :/ I did not receive the support to successfully complete the degree; the gender imbalance was unreal for little 18 year old me (100:3) and I was the only black girl...eek! Furthermore, I was struggling - most of the fellow students had prior knowledge or miles ahead of me. As the first to attend university, I opted to change degrees as I did not have the heart to miserable to fail. I have no regrets on my career path - just lessons learned and back on the career path I want to pursue.
 * You have one life to live - You have the power to change the trajectory of your life. This process of changing my career is giving me a new lease after losing my father, who dedicated his life for his family. He believed in everything I did and proud of me regardless of my decisions. He lived life to the fullest he can, so why can't I and have fun along the way.
 * I am a problem solver and like to get things done - I may be slow as a snail or as fast as cheetah but I will get to the end result. The willpower in me will always try because you will either get 'true' or 'false' statement, opposed to 'false' for not trying.
 * The skills gained from current career in Higher Education are transferable skills - I believe I am good communicator, team player, meet new people and keen eye for detail, etc.
 * Ability to be a role model to young girls, in particular BAME girls who want to go into software engineering. Traditional professions such as Accountancy, Law and Teaching are still advocated to young BAME girls as the subjects to select vocationally or academically. I want to be able to support young BAME girls to choose their passion over the profession.
 * I love the Tech Community - Why wouldn't I want to part of a community that has been so encouraging me both physically and virtually. If the community existed whilst I studied at university, I do not think I would have quit.

 2019 - 20
 As I am pursuing the self-taught route into Software Development, I have given myself 12 months (August 2019) to fulfil my goal to obtain a role as a Junior Software Enigineer or Associate Software Engineer.

I have been inspired by @ Nirvikalpa108's learning plan outlined in Sprints. So, I will be adopting this type of agile process.

My learning objectives for July - August 2019 (Q3 in 2019) - subject to change:
* Learn and complete Ruby using Codecademy (10 lessons). Use Youtube and Udemy to support  the learning, if necessary. Practice on Codewars and Excercism.
* Introduction to Javascript - Node Girls Workshop
* Gain a better understanding of technical tests.
* Attend Codebar weekly - Ruby tutorial and Technical Tests exploration.
* Attend Codebar's Uncoderbar conference in September 2019.
* Actively document my programming journey on Twitter.

Projects to undertake in 2019:
* Create a dynamic, responsive blog using the skills obtained in CF:G.

Previous Sprints:

Q3 in 2019: July 2019 - Completed Code First: Girls web developmnent programme @ NewDay, August 2019 - Attended spoke about my CF:Girls experience at Coding Black Females meetup.

Q2 in 2019: April 2019 - Attended women tech meetup: Women in Tech Meetup (Salesforce). Started my programming journey learning Javascript from freeCodeCamp.  June 2019 - Went to my first tech conference: Wonder Woman in Tech conference.
