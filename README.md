# learningObjectives
 My aim is to successfully transition careers to become a Junior Software Engineer. I have been encouraged to document my journey, so here it goes....

 First, I want to establish my 'why' to be consistent with my learning:

 * My first degree @ University was in Computer Science and I was excited about the prospect of studying it. However, I quit after my first year. I did not receive the support to successfully complete the degree; the gender imbalance was unreal for 18 year old me and I was the only black girl on the degree programme. Furthermore, I was struggling - most of my fellow students had prior knowledge and were miles ahead of me. As the first in my family to attend university, I opted to change degrees as I did not have the heart to fail miserably. I have no regrets changing my academic path - life is full of curveballs and now I am back on the right path.
 * You have one life to live - You have the power to change the trajectory of your life. This process of changing my career has given me a new lease after losing my father, who dedicated his life to his family. He believed in everything I did and was proud of me regardless. He lived life to the fullest he could, I promise to do the same.
 * Love learning new things - Learning new things so far in my journey has stretched my knowledge and capabilities, which has been rewarding and satisfying. I want to become more acquainted in both front end and back end software development.
 * The skills gained from my current career in Higher Education are transferable - I believe I am a good communicator, team player, willingness to learn new things and have a keen eye for detail.
 * Ability to be a role model to young girls, in particular BAME girls who want to go into software engineering or other tech roles. Traditional professions such as Accountancy, Law and Teaching are still advocated to young BAME girls as the subjects to select vocationally or academically. I want to be able to support young BAME girls to choose their passion over the profession.
 * I love the Tech Community - Why wouldn't I want to part of a community that has been so encouraging in both physical and virtual spaces. If this community existed whilst I studied at university, I do not think I would have quit.

 ## 2019 - 20
 As I am pursuing the self-taught route into Software Development, I have given myself 12 months (August 2019) to fulfil my goal to obtain a role as a Junior Software Engineer or Associate Software Engineer.

I have been inspired by @Nirvikalpa108's learning plan outlined in Sprints. So, I will be adopting this type of agile process.

My learning objectives for July - September 2019 (Q3 in 2019) - subject to change:

## Personal

* Finish what I’ve started: Spend 30 mins each morning or evening undertaking Codebar’s HTML and CSS tutorials (3 – 4). **Complete by 19 September 2019.**
* Study Ruby for an hour each morning prior to work with Codecamedy and Codebar tutorials. NB: On Saturdays, spend two hours in the morning.  If you need further clarification on concepts, use Codebar slack, Youtube, Twitter and/or Stackoverflow. **Complete by 19 September 2019.**
* Once I’ve completed Codecamedy and Codebar tutorial’s on Ruby, attempt one Codewars and Exercism challenge. **Complete by 26 September 2019.**
* Start to work through the Flatiron School bootcamp prep course online - This will allow me to reaffirm my learning in HTML, CSS, Ruby and introduce JavaScript to my learning. Complete HTML and CSS elements of the course by **26 September 2019** for an hour each morning prior to work.

## Events:

* Attend Codebar workshop, ideally once a week if possible - I will utilise my time with a Coach to clarify Ruby concepts that I may not be familiar with, blog project or Flatiron bootcamp prep course. Workshops are run on 4, 11, 18 and 25 September 2019.
* Undertake ‘Introduction to JavaScript’ - Node Girls Workshop on 31 August 2019, London. Assess whether JavaScript is a language that I would like to pursue.
* Attend (and possibly partake) Codebar's Uncoderbar conference on 14 September 2019, London.

## Project:

To utilise my skills obtained from Code First: Girls create a responsive, dynamic blog from scratch via Github pages. During this sprint, I will create the wireframes for the blog.  Write two brief articles (no more than 5 mins read) about my programming journey on the commute to or from work. **Complete by 25 September 2019.**  

## Bonus – only if I am ahead of the game:

Explore open source using the resources obtained at Codebar. Contribute to one of Codebar’s open source documents. **Complete by 26 September 2019.**
